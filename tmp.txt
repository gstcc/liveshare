Idea: A plugin that allows users to work on the same file using pynvim

Server: Use Python for backend collaboration, networking, and orchestration. Here is the actual document, handle changes, send changes
Client: Use pynvim to connect to session/server, send buffer changes, rececive remote edits

Should use some sort of auth (like live share vscode)
socket.io or websockets?

Need to write plugin in lua that attaches to buf_attach and then does a callback to python plugin part which then can handle the rest
Should probably switch to on_bytes instead of on_lines as it contains more information
